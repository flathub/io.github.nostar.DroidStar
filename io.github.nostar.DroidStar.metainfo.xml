  <summary>A digital voice client</summary>
  <description>
    <p>DroidStar is an application that allows you to use digital modes such as M17, D-Star,
      Fusion and DMR from a computer. It connects to a reflector server and sends and receives
      audio encoded in Codec2 or AMBE. It also displays information about the users and modules
      connected to the reflector.</p>
    <p>Some modes may require an external vocoder plugin that can be downloaded from a URL, which
      will place the vocoder into the correct location for the platform. Add a full http url,
      including the filename, to the Vocoder URL option on the Settings tab, and click
      the Download vocoder button.</p>
    <p>For Android and iOS devices, the vocoder URL download method is the only way to
      load a vocoder plugin. For Linux, a vocoder can also be placed manually.</p>
    <p>To do this, copy the plugin to the system settings file location. On Linux, this is
      ~/.var/app/io.github.nostar.DroidStar/config/dudetronics - it is the same place
      where the host and id files are located (DMRHosts.txt, DMRIDs.data, etc).</p>
    <p>The vocoder plugin filename must be named vocoder_plugin.platform.arch
      where platform should be linux and arch can be x86_64 or arm64 depending
      on your system. The arch for your device is identified on the About tab.</p>
